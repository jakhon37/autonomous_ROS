[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrviz_common.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rviz_common", but CMake did not find one.

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/ubuntu/my_space/autonomous_ROS/build/slam_toolbox/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rviz_common" with
  any of the following names:

    rviz_commonConfig.cmake
    rviz_common-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rviz_common" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rviz_common_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "rviz_common" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
